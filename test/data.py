    "summary": "These chocolate Kiss cookies are like a cheater’s version of Russian teacakes. But enhanced with a chocolate Kiss. And you only need 3 ingredients to make them!",
    "steps": "Place the pie crust onto a floured surface and cut into two-inch squares. Because the crust is likely a circle, a couple sections may be a bit skimpy. If that happens, take crust from two skimpy sections and smoosh it together to make a section big enough to contain a Kiss. This is not an exact science, it’s okay if not all sections are exactly the same size.-Place one Kiss in the middle of each square, then pinch the dough around it to seal it in. Bake the chocolate Kiss cookies for roughly 15 minutes.-Let the Kiss cookies cool for another 1o to 15 minutes until cool enough to dredge in sugar.",

    "ingredients": "1/2 cup unsalted butter, browned-1 large egg- 3/4 cup light brown sugar, packed-1/4 cup granulated sugar-2 teaspoons vanilla extract-1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour-2 teaspoons cornstarch-1 teaspoon baking soda-1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste-1/2 cup mini semi-sweet chocolate chips-1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips-2 tablespoons unsalted butter",
    "summary": "The dough is made with browned butter, studded with mini chocolate chips, and the centers are stuffed with melted chocolate lava.",
    "steps": "Preheat oven to 350F and liberally spray a 12-count standard-sized muffin pan generously with cooking spray; set aside.-Cookie Cups – Brown the butter (click for a detailed tutorial) by cooking butter over medium heat in a medium saucepan until it’s amber to brown in color, about 5 minutes depending on pan size. I swirl the pan in the last minute or so to make sure I can really see the color changes. Butter will go through stages of hissing, sputtering, and making noise until the water cooks off at which point the browning occurs. Butter will smell nutty and aromatic.-Pour butter into a large mixing bowl, making sure to scrape the bottom of the saucepan with a spatula and transfer any browned bits (they have wonderful flavor) from the bottom of pan into the mixing bowl. Wait momentarily before adding the egg so you don’t scramble it.-Add the egg, sugars, vanilla, and whisk to combine.-Add flour, cornstarch (keeps cookies soft) baking soda, salt, and stir to combine. Dough may seem crumbly yet oily, this is okay.-Add the mini chocolate chips and stir to combine.-Using a large cookie scoop, 1/4-cup measure, or your hands, form approximately 10 equal-sized mounds of dough, roll into balls, and place one mound of dough in each cavity in muffin pan; it’s okay if it doesn’t touch the sides because it will spread in the oven.-Bake for about 11 to 13 minutes, or until edges have set and tops are just set, even if slightly undercooked, pale, and glossy in the center; don’t overbake. Cookie cups firm up as they cool.-Using the bottom of a shot glass, lightly press down in the center of each cookie cup going about 1/2-inch to 3/4-inch deep to create a well where the chocolate lava will be added later. Tip – If your shot glass is sticking to the cookie cups, spray it with cooking spray as necessary. Set pan aside while you make the chocolate lava.-Chocolate Lava – To a medium microwave-safe bowl, add the chocolate chips, butter, and heat on high power to melt, about 45 seconds. Heat in additional 15-second bursts as necessary until chocolate can be stirred smooth. (Note – The lava made this way sets up at room temp. If you prefer it to stay soft and melty make this chocolate ganache which is made with cream rather than butter.)-Using a small spoon, add about 1 rounded teaspoon of chocolate to each cookie cup. Depending on how deep you went with the shot glass, you may need to melt additional chocolate chips in order to fill each cup up completely.-Allow cookie cups to remain in pan for about 15 minutes before removing and serving. Cookie cups will keep airtight at room temperature for up to 5 days.",
